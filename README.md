Paper-like projects from the course "Computational Astronomy" I took in 3rd year Physics

This repository includes only the "output" of the course, during which we had to develop 3 projects, each of them focusing on one of the following themes:

1. Data Analysis: Given the observed spectra of two stars and a large list of synthetic spectra (corresponding to different stellar parameter combinations), we had to find out which of the synthetic spectra better fit the observed ones and, consequently find out the parameters of the real stars. This involved changing and manipulating the data to exclude rotational velocity in the real spectra, simulate instrumental characteristics in the synthetic spectra through convolution, etc.

2. Modelling: Having chosen two stars for which the masses, luminosities and radii are known, we learned how to model the thermodynamic behaviour of their interiors to fit the observational data. In my project, I was then able to relate what I found about one of the stars I chose to the conclusions of a research paper on the same star. This project ended with a Monte Carlo simulation method to estimate the error in my results.

3. Simulation: In the last project, we had to do a N-body simulation of a system of our choosing. I tried to simulate the time evolution of the Kepler-47 system, which consist of a binary couple of orbiting stars and 3 exoplanets. In the end, the system was to complicated and the N-body assumptions were not enough to properly simulate it. It was still nice to see a relatively good performance in the code I had written.

All the images and results were fully calculated and programmed by me. At the time I developed the projects inside Jupyter Notebooks, so they're not suitable for GitHub. For this reason this repository only contains the PDF files of my work.
